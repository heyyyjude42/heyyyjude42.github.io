    <div>
      <p>For this project, I partnered up with three other classmates to create a website for the startup Buy Me A
        Coffee. The goal of this project is to design a website entirely from scratch, knowing only the goal of the
        startup, which is to make it easy for online content creators to get paid. Through several iterations and
        revisions of design concepts, we ultimately developed a functional <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/proto/wAsw5G540Iw4CNsqYwGOXX/Buy-Me-A-Coffee---Interaction?scaling=contain&node-id=3%3A29">Figma
          prototype</a> from scratch, without
        looking at the startup's existing website. We then conducted user testing through UserTesting.com, and
        re-evaluated our design based on the results we received.

    <div>
      <p> In the generation of crowdfunding with products such as Kickstarter and Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee takes a new
        angle by emphasizing small donations equated to real-life items, like coffee and cookies. Creators will be able
        to earn passive income and grow their online presence through the website.</p>
      <p>Below is the home page of our final design iteration.</p>

    <div class="content-caption">Initial Sketches</div>
    <div>
      <img class="img-float-right" src="../assets/portfolio/Buy-Me-A-Coffee-Sketches.jpeg">
      <p>One of the things we considered during the process of sketching was how to make the interface appealing to two
        different demographics: the creators themselves, and the donators. We wanted to make sure that the interface met
        the needs of both user groups.</p>
      <p>We decided to go with figure 1 because the home page best represented the diverse target audiences of users
        (artists, podcasters, educators), while the profile page enabled the user to engage with its fans through posts
        and a gallery of their content, rather than focusing on monetary statistics (fig 3).</p>
      <p>
        Some versions attempted to recommend personal suggestions to users, but the reality is that Buy Me A Coffee
        wasn’t made for a user’s entertainment—it’s a donation platform, and to bring in a larger customer base,
        creators have to feel incentivized that their profiles might actually be seen. Hence, we went with figure 1
        because it allowed the most flexible number of diverse categories to be presented in a neutral fashion, allowing
        more fairness in terms of what is advertised.

      <p>As we began to turn from paper to Figma, we discussed as a group on what we wanted the tone of the website to
        be. In the end, we settled on colors and typography reminiscent of a cafe to evoke the casual nature of the
        donations, and our initial concepts are shown to the right. Another team member also made custom icons in Adobe
        Illustrator that aligned more with our visual language.</p>

          prototype</a> to see more of it!</p>

    <div class="content-caption">Reiterations after Feedback</div>
    <div>
      <p>After hearing feedback from other classmates, we made some changes and adjustments to how certain pages are
        displayed to the user. For instance, one suggestion was to tie the donation page closer to the user profile, so
        contributors 1) can easily confirm they are indeed donating to the right person, and 2) invoke empathy by
        reminding them they are contributing to the livelihood of one of their favorite creators. And so we updated the
        flow of the donation process to be nested within the user profile itself.</p>
      <p>We also submitted our prototype to UserTesting.com for feedback, where users were instructed to navigate to a
        person's profile, select a coffee donation, and purchase the coffee. Overall, users were able to complete these
        tasks quickly, though some users noted how many pages they had to navigate through in order to complete the
        donation process. Technical issues also persisted with two users being unable to scroll the page, though we are
        unsure if that is an issue with Figma itself or our prototype.</p>

    <div class="content-caption">Conclusion</div>
    <div>
      <p>My role in this project was primarily contributing towards the design side—the initial sketches were mine, as
        were the foundations for the overall site wireframe we ended up using. However, this was very much a group
        effort, as we experimented with many different color palettes, font combinations, and layouts to evoke the
        welcoming atmosphere we wanted to give. We consulted each other at nearly every step of the process, tweaking
        elements as we went—from enlarging the user's picture on their profile page to help identify with them, to
        cleaning up overall design consistency.</p>
