      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Designs for Publishing</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Adobe InDesign & Print  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  June 2016 — Present</div>
      A large collection of materials designed for the World Scholar's Cup, which were used at enormous tournaments. Each of these went through critical reviews: who is this information for, and what do they know already? What is the clearest way to present information to them?

      <img src="assets/portfolio/DnD-Dungeon-Generator-Medium.jpeg">
      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Mystery Dungeon</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Java, JavaScript, Python & SQL  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Apr — May 2019</div>
      A helper tool for the narrative game Dungeons and Dragons, which features a random dungeon generator, an enhanced REPL for rapid commands, and a battle manager. The goal was to reduce the number of tabs one has to navigate between and bring commonly-used information together. The data was scraped with BeautifulSoup, and the project was designed with real users in mind.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Quiz Bowl</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">React  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Aug — Sep 2019</div>
      This summer, I wrote a few dozen <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> quiz bowl questions for my friends. I didn't want to flip between tossups and bonuses while keeping track of scores, so I wrote this app to help me and other quiz bowl moderators multitask in one place.

    <div class="portfolio-item"><a href="portfolio/game-engine.html">
      <img src="assets/portfolio/Game-Engine-Tic.jpg">
      <div class="portfolio-item-title">2D Game Engine</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Java  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Sep 2019 — Present</div>
      A work-in-progress 2D game engine written entirely from scratch, following the entity-component system design pattern. It includes a self-made, responsive UI toolkit, and was extensibly designed for many diverse games to be created with it.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Waluigi Time</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">C++ & GLSL  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Nov — Dec 2018</div>
      A Waluigi-themed minigame created in virtual reality, in which the player navigates through a field of columns, throwing tennis balls at targets displaying Waluigi's enemies. The scene is procedurally generated each game, and all the graphics and physics components were built from scratch. Made for the Vive system.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Titled in Raleway</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Adobe InDesign  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Apr — May 2016</div>
      A book I wrote for my independent study course, Typography and Lettering. I'm a huge font nerd, and this book goes over type classifications, developing hierarchies, and layout fundamentals. It was a follow-up to a graphic design class I taught to my school's faculty, and the PDF was later circulated in the community. For me, it was also an initial foray into book layout design and typesetting.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Risk: World Domination</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Java & JavaFX  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Nov — Dec 2017</div>
      A digital recreation of the popular board game Risk, with custom-made graphics and support for 2-6 players. Players can also choose to play against AI opponents, which make decisions using a weight-based algorithm.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Shortcuts</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">React  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Mar 2018</div>
      An app I made for fun to help others learn Adobe CC's various shortcuts in a dynamic way. The app takes in the user's current keyboard input and displays the corresponding shortcut. I first learned all these shortcuts through experimentation and accidental presses, but I'm still learning more, and I've certainly learned a lot through just making this app itself.

      <img src="assets/portfolio/Dash-Thumbnail.jpg">
      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Dash Redesign</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">React & TypeScript  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Mar 2019</div>
      When my lab migrated our project, Dash, from C# and the .NET framework to React, I was tasked with overhauling our user interface. Since our project was made for the everyday layman, we highly valued intuitiveness and elegance.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Hierarchy</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">React  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Apr 2018</div>
      You can probably tell by now that I love typography, and I made this app to showcase some of my favorite Google Fonts combinations. Each time the page is loaded, it inserts random dummy text from works of literature, and users can tap specific sets of fonts to see how it looks in a longer body of text.

      <img src="assets/portfolio/Maps-Pathfinding.jpg">

      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Java, JavaScript & SQL  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Mar — Apr 2019</div>
      An app that displays Open Street Map data, with color-coded support for traffic data. Users can search for intersections or click two points to find the shortest path between them. Optimized for speed, with support for pan and zoom.

      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">React & Google Apps Scripts  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Mar 2018 — May 2019</div>
      Throughout my journey with the World Scholar's Cup, I found many processes that could be streamlined with CS. After all, we routinely ran hundreds of events a year. I made a tool to automatically generate shipping, printing, and catering lists based on how many students are registered, and also added Google Sheets extensions to validate rosters, formatting, and essay scores.

    <div class="portfolio-item"><a>
      <img src="assets/portfolio/Tetris-Shiny-Thumbnail.jpeg">
      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Tetris</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Java & JavaFX  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Nov 2017</div>
      A fully-functional game of Tetris written using JavaFX. The user can choose which Tetris block texture to use, and the difficulty of the game increases as the player clears more lines. Also supports a placement preview for falling blocks.

      <div class="portfolio-item-title">Freelance Graphic Design</div>
      <div class="portfolio-item-subtitle">Adobe CC  &nbsp;/&nbsp;  Mar 2015 — Jun 2016</div>
      During high school, I worked as a freelance graphic designer for my school. I made promotional posters and event materials for many of our official department events, such as Pi Day and the Arts Festival, as well as the yearbook every year. I also served as the head designer for our school newspaper, the Spartan Times.
