            <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a narrative roleplaying game with extremely complex mechanics, where each player
                has to maintain a detailed character sheet throughout their campaign. Modern players often turn to
                web-based interfaces to help them keep track of their character’s many statistics, features, items, and
                spells, and one such service is <a href="https://dicecloud.com/">DiceCloud</a>. This program allows
                users to create and manage characters, and takes care of many tedious calculations that are
                usually done by hand—which is fantastic in concept, but has a cluttered interface that makes it
                unintuitive to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>As a <i>huge</i> fan of D&D, and also a user of DiceCloud, I teamed up with another developer in my
                campaign party to embark upon a quest to redesign it from the ground up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-caption">The Original DiceCloud</div>
        <div>
            <p>DiceCloud's interface is mostly just a list of cards stacked on a page, and although there is some order
                to their placement, there exist few visual cues for users to guess where they might find a given
                number. This inefficient design, on top of inefficiently used whitespace, unnecessarily adds to the
                intensity of memorability and learnability required to use DiceCloud effectively.
            </p>
            <img class="img-float-center" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Original-Others.jpeg">
            <p>
                Many of DiceCloud’s features and editing of certain elements are hidden beneath menus and clickable
                headings. For example, editing one’s class requires one to click the class name, and editing ability
                scores requires clicking “base ability scores” under features. It is not initially clear which elements
                are clickable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of learnability, DiceCloud is difficult to learn for new users. When you create a character,
                you are thrust onto the main screen with no indication as to where to begin. The Journal tab is where
                one begins to add properties
                such as race bonuses and classes. The Features tab is where one edits ability scores (strength,
                dexterity, etc). Many users do not initially realize that you can click many of the elements, such as
                the “Speed” box, to reference how their numbers are calculated. This stems from a lack of affordances in
                the design. Many core rules, such as adding the Constitution score to HP, are done automatically, and a
                user is not informed of this.
            </p>
            <img class="img-float-right" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Original-Home.jpeg">
            <p>When a user becomes used to DiceCloud, managing characters while playing DnD becomes very efficient. A
                user can add formulas to certain elements, such as hit points (HP). These formulas allow one to level up
                quickly, instead of manually adding numbers in. If one is organized enough, the features page can be
                very easy to navigate. The spells tab is a great way to manage prepared spells and spell lists, when it
                is set up properly.
                However, DiceCloud is very expensive in terms of whitespace: the six ability modifiers unnecessarily
                take up ⅛ of the whole screen, and the Inventory screen is filled with cards that don’t need a whole
                card to themselves. It can be inefficient to require so much navigation and searching in the middle of a
                play session.
            </p>
            <p>Because DiceCloud hides many features behind menus, much of character creation is difficult to do. One
                has to manually set aspects such as Hit Dice, Speed, and HP every time a new character is made. It is
                difficult to remember where to place these, and the program gives no guidance on this matter. Formulas
                and certain variables exist for different aspects of one’s character, such as an ability score or
                ability modifier, but the variables are hard to remember without referencing them (e.g. [strengthMod],
                case sensitive).</p>

        <div class="content-caption">Wireframe Redesign</div>
        <div>
            <p>With our wireframe in place, we set out to fill in the blanks and visually redesign DiceCloud using
                Figma. We ultimately utilized a similar card system that capitalized on simplicity, efficiency, and
                clarity.</p>
            <img class="img-float-center border" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Wireframe-Stats.jpeg">
            <img class="img-float-right border" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Wireframe-Features.jpeg">
            <img class="img-float-right border" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Redesign-Features.jpeg">
            <p>Pictured above is our new stats screen, with more visual cues to help with user navigation, and to fit
                everything onto one (desktop) screen. We reorganized information to be more intuitive to find; instead
                of scattering numbers everywhere for the statistics page, we grouped related elements firmly together,
                such as the six base character statistics. These can now toggle between raw scores, ability modifiers,
                and saving throw modifiers, which are intensely related. </p>
            <p>To the right is our new features screen, which can now collapse cards—something DiceCloud doesn't do!
                Overall, it just features more efficient use of screen real estate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-caption">High-Fidelity Mockup</div>
        <div>
            <p>As we filled in our wireframes with high-fidelity elements, we also greatly reduced the aggressiveness of
                DiceCloud’s color-tagging system while maintaining its core functionality. You can see the direct
                comparison between one set of wireframe design to the visual redesign to the right. Overall, we improved
                the visual & informational hierarchy to more easily tell what properties a player has at all times.
                <img class="img-float-right border" src="../assets/portfolio/DiceCloud-Redesign-Home.jpeg">
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-caption">Bonus Features</div>
        <div>
            <p>Outside of these redesigns, we also shuffled some functionality around and added three ideal features of
                our own. The first is a character builder: when a user creates a character, they will be taken to a
                character creation page to set the initial parameters such as race, class, and ability scores. This
                allows for much faster character creation, and autofills the requisite fields such a HP and
                proficiencies. In the original DiceCloud, the user would have to hunt for each of these fields
                individually in different places.</p>
            <p>The second feature we thought would be tremendously helpful in interface efficiency is being able to
                search and filter for spells. This prevents a user from having to comb through the entire list to find a
                spell they need for a specific situation—they could search by concentration spells, or bonus action
                spells, or spells that last longer than one turn.
            </p>
            <p>The last one sounds simple, but could actually be quite important—a quick, easy-to-reach notes field. The
                notes section where users can type whatever they want can easily replace many of the other complex
                mechanics that DiceCloud implemented (such as the number of death saving throws or exhaustion levels),
                which were distracting and difficult to remember how to add since they rarely come up during campaigns
                anyways. Players can jot those down as they come.
            </p>
