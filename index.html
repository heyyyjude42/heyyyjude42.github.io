            I currently study computer science at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, with a focus on
            human-computing interaction, visual design, and education. Hardly a day ever passes without thinking about
            my next project, whether it's an app to supplement my never-ending escapades in Dungeons and Dragons, or to
            help quiz bowl moderators keep track of questions and scores.

            <br><br>Since teaching myself Adobe InDesign at the age of fourteen, I've always known I wanted to spend my
            life building and creating. I'm also a big fan of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, Nintendo games, and
            breadmaking.

            <p>My concentration may be in CS, but my interests lie in its applications and intersections with other

            Attended an (incredible!) international school in Beijing, which used the AP curriculum. In my senior year,
            I also completed two year-long independent studies: Superconductive Electromagnetism and Typography &
            Lettering. I was also a TA for AP Physics 1, Graphic Design, and Archaeology & the Ancient World.

            Under the supervision of Professor Andries van Dam, I worked with a small team to develop <a

            <ul>
              <li>Developed in C# and the .NET framework, as well as React and TypeScript</li>
              <li>Completely redesigned the application's graphical interface</li>
              <li>Implemented other features such as exporting scattered notes in a clean, organized way, while

          <p>
            During my gap year, I worked for <a href="https://scholarscup.org/">World Scholar's Cup</a>, an
            international organization that runs events for over 50,000 students in 70 countries. Our mission is to
            spread the joy of learning and encouraged interdisciplinary self-exploration; we also gave out stuffed
            alpacas to each student. This brought me on a whirlwind journey across the world; during this time, I
            interacted with teachers, administrators, government officials, convention centers, and too many T-shirt
            vendors to name.
            <ul>
              <li>Led setup and logistical coordination for over 50 events, the largest of which took place in Kuala
                Lumpur in June 2018, which brought together 4500 attendants from over 40 countries</li>
              <li>Recruited and met with over 100 schools in over 20 cities across the world</li>
