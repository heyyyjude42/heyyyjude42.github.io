            I currently study computer science at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, with a focus on
            human-computing interaction, visual design, and education. Hardly a day ever passes without thinking about
            my next project, whether it's an app to supplement my never-ending escapades in Dungeons and Dragons, or to
            help quiz bowl moderators keep track of questions and scores.

            <br><br>Since teaching myself Adobe InDesign at the age of fourteen, I've always known I wanted to spend my
            life building and creating. I'm also a big fan of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, Nintendo games, and
            cardboard boxes.

      <div class="section-desc">
      <p>
      After high school, I took a gap year to work with the <a href="http://scholarscup.org/">World Scholar's Cup</a>, an international education organization that aims to spread the joy of learning. At Brown, I went on to research at the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/">Pen and Touch Computing Center</a>, and became heavily involved in the CS department's TA program. Right now, I'm a Head TA for Brown's largest undergraduate class, <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CSCI 0150</a>.
      <br><br>
      Outside of computer science, I also taught Adobe InDesign for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brown-pass/home?authuser=0">PASS</a>, and served as a design editor for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/">Brown Daily Herald</a>.

            Attended an (incredible!) international school in Beijing, which used the AP curriculum. In my senior year,

            Lettering. I was also a TA for AP Physics 1, Graphic Design, and Archaeology & the Ancient World.

            I currently lead a staff of 45 other TAs to teach Brown's largest undergraduate course, <a

            international organization that runs events for over 50,000 students in 70 countries. Our mission is to
            spread the joy of learning and encouraged interdisciplinary self-exploration; we also gave out stuffed
            alpacas to each student. This brought me on a whirlwind journey across the world; during this time, I
            interacted with teachers, administrators, government officials, convention centers, and too many T-shirt
            vendors to name.
            <ul>
              <li>Led setup and logistical coordination for over 50 events, the largest of which took place in Kuala
