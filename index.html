            I currently study computer science at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, with a focus on human-computing interaction, visual design, and education. Hardly a day ever passes without thinking about my next project, whether it's an app to supplement my never-ending escapades in Dungeons and Dragons, or to help quiz bowl moderators keep track of questions and scores.

            <br><br>Since teaching myself Adobe InDesign at the age of fourteen, I've always known I wanted to spend my life building and creating. I'm also a big fan of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, Nintendo games, and cardboard boxes.

      <div class="section-desc">
      <p>
      After high school, I took a gap year to work with the <a href="http://scholarscup.org/">World Scholar's Cup</a>, an international education organization that aims to spread the joy of learning. At Brown, I went on to research at the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/">Pen and Touch Computing Center</a>, and became heavily involved in the CS department's TA program. Right now, I'm a Head TA for Brown's largest undergraduate class, <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CSCI 0150</a>.
      <br><br>
      Outside of computer science, I also taught Adobe InDesign for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brown-pass/home?authuser=0">PASS</a>, and served as a design editor for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/">Brown Daily Herald</a>.

      <p>
        I currently lead a staff of 45 other TAs to teach Brown's largest undergraduate course, <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CSCI 0150: Object Oriented Programming</a>, with over 400 students enrolled. My main responsibilities include:

        Under the supervision of Professor Andries van Dam, I worked with a small team to develop <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/project/dash">Dash</a>, an experimental, freeform note-taking environment with a focus on pen and touch computing.
        <ul>
          <li>Developed in C# and the .NET framework, as well as React and TypeScript</li>
          <li>Completely redesigned the application's graphical interface</li>
          <li>Implemented other features such as exporting scattered notes in a clean, organized way, while maintaining the linking framework that connects the notes together</li>

        During my gap year, I worked for <a href="http://scholarscup.org/">World Scholar's Cup</a>, an international organization that runs events for over 50,000 students in 70 countries. Our mission is to spread the joy of learning and encouraged interdisciplinary self-exploration; we also gave out stuffed alpacas to each student. This brought me on a whirlwind journey across the world; during this time, I interacted with teachers, administrators, government officials, convention centers, and too many T-shirt vendors to name.
        <ul>
          <li>Led setup and logistical coordination for over 50 events, the largest of which took place in Kuala Lumpur in June 2018, which brought together 4500 attendants from over 40 countries</li>
          <li>Recruited and met with over 100 schools in over 20 cities across the world</li>
          <li>Assisted thousands of students, teachers, and parents via email from afar</li>
