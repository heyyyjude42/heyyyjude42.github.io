      I taught myself Adobe InDesign when I was 14, and since then, I've always wanted to spend my life creating. Hardly a day ever passes without thinking about my next project—whether it's an app to supplement my never-ending escapades in Dungeons and Dragons, or to help Quiz Bowl masters keep track of questions and scores. My passion sits here at the intersection of art, the humanities, and science, where I get to work on what I love to help the people I love.

      After high school, I took a gap year to work with the <a href="http://scholarscup.org/">World Scholar's Cup</a>, a nonprofit academic enrichment initiative that aims to spread the joy of learning. At Brown, I went on to research at the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/">Pen and Touch Computing Center</a>, while teaching InDesign for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brown-pass/home?authuser=0">PASS</a>, and being a design editor for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/">Brown Daily Herald</a>. Since then, I've also been heavily involved in Brown's undergraduate TA program, having been a TA every semester since sophomore year. I currently serve as a Head TA for our largest introductory course, <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CSCI 0150</a>.
